# 🗺️ journy.us

journy is an interactive geography game built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Skeleton UI](https://www.skeleton.dev/). The inspiration came from when I realized, I'm terrible at playing [travle](https://www.travle.earth/usa). The game challenges players to journey from a randomly selected start state to a target state by guessing neighboring states within a limited number of guesses.

Try the game [here](https://www.journy.us/)!
